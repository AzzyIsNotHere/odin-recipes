    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
      <li>
        Make the meat sauce: Add beef and sausage to a large skillet, over
        medium-high heat whilst breaking it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the
        onion and garlic. Cook until the meat is browned, about seven minutes.
        Then, drain the fat from the meat and return the meat to the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, sugar, 2
        teaspoons of salt, 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon of
        basil, and the black pepper. Stir until well-combined. Cover and reduce
        the heat to low. Simmer the sauce for 30 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons
        of the minced parsley.
      </li>
      <li>
        As the sauce cooks, make the ricotta mixture. In a large bowl, add 1 cup
        mozzarella, the ricotta, ¼ cup parmesan, 2 tablespoons of the parsley,
        the egg, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, and ½ teaspoon
        basil. Stir until well incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>Cook the pasta al dente, according to it’s package directions.</li>
      <li>
        Assemble the lasagna. In a 13x9 inch baking dish, add a very thin layer
        of meat sauce (about ¼ cup). Layer 3 lasagna noodles, ⅓ of the ricotta
        mixture, and 1 ½ (level) cups of meat sauce. Repeat the layers twice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a final layer of the remaining noodles, meat sauce, 1 cup
        mozzarella, and ¼ cup parmesan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with foil that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Bake
        for 45 minutes. Remove the foil. Bake 15 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Let the lasagna cool for 15-20 minutes before cutting.</li>
    </ol>
