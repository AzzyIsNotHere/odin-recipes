      <li>1 3/4 cups of all purpose flour</li>
      <li>
        3/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder (naturally processed, like

      </li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>1 cup of buttermilk well shaken (full-fat if you can find it)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of canola oil</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup of hot water (does not need to be boiling)</li>
    </ul>
    For the frosting:
    <ul>
      <li>16 tablespoons of unsalted butter, at room temperature (2 sticks)</li>
      <li>
        1 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder (naturally processed, like Hershey's)
      </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>8 ounces of cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
      <li>4 cups of powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    Make the cake:
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
      <li>Butter and lightly flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, add the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking
        powder, and salt. Stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the buttermilk, canola oil, eggs, and vanilla. Use an electric mixer
        to beat on medium speed for two minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the hot water to the cake batter. Mix on medium speed until well
        combined (the batter will be runny).
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the batter between the two cake pans. Gently tap the pans on the
        countertop to release some of the air bubbles in the batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake on a center oven rack for 32 to 34 minutes. A toothpick inserted
        into the center of the cake should come out with moist crumbs, but no
        raw batter on it. Test the cake for doneness at 32 minutes, even if it
        looks like the center needs to rise more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool for 15 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans. Place the cakes on
        wire cooling racks until they have cooled completely (around 2 hours).
      </li>
      Make the frosting:
      <li>
        Add the butter to a medium size sauce pot and place over medium-low
        heat. Heat until the butter has just melted. Remove the pot from the
        heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cocoa powder, vanilla, and salt to the butter. Stir until the
        cocoa is smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, add the room temperature cream cheese. Whisk with an
        electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy (about 2 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>Add half of the powdered sugar. Beat until combined.</li>
      <li>Add half of the chocolate butter. Beat until combined.</li>
      <li>
        Repeat, alternating with the remaining powdered sugar and chocolate
        butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat on medium-high speed for two
        minutes, until fluffy.
      </li>
      Frost the cake:
      <li>
        Place one of the cooled cake rounds on a cake plate. Add about ⅓ of the
        frosting. Spread evenly over the top of the cake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with the second cake round. Add ⅓ of the frosting. Spread evenly
        over the top of the cake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the remaining ⅓ of the frosting to cover the sides of the cake.
      </li>
    </ol>
