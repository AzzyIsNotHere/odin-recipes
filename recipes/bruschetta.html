      <li>
        Cut the baguette on a diagonal into ½ to ¾ of an inch slices (makes

        a broiler set to high until the top of the bread is lightly toasted.

        Add the feta, yogurt, garlic, and 1 tablespoon of basil to a small bowl
        and mash together with a fork. Store covered in the refrigerator for up
        to 8 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, add the olive oil, vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper.
        Whisk until well combined. Add the tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and
        remaining basil. Stir to combine. Store covered in the refrigerator for
        up to 8 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the feta mixture between the bread slices. Spread into a thin
        layer on the toasted side of the bread. Top with the tomato mixture.
